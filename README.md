# Implement puyopuyo on python.  

## For my master research.  

I research deep reinforcement learning as a master student.  
My research theme is applying RL for puyopuyo to create strong game AI.  
I develop with python, so I had to implement puyopuyo simulator on python.  

This program has tokoton puyopuyo mode only(for one person).  
So, I should implement battle mode sometime.  
And actually, I use the other program specialized for experiment instead of this program.  
This program is for play.  
Special library used on this program is pygame only.
